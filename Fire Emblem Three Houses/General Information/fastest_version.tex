The fastest version of the game is the Digital Download on the Nintendo Switch's Internal Memory, not the SD card. If your digital copy is on the SD card, you can move it to memory by doing the following:
 
 \begin{enumerate}
\item On the Switch's Home Menu, System Settings
\item Data Management
\item Move Data Between System / microSD Card
\item Move to System Memory, then pick Fire Emblem: Three Houses
\end{enumerate}
