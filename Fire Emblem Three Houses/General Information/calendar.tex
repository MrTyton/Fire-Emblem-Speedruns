\begin{itemize}
\item After the Dancing Competition in Chapter 9, you can sell all of your tea leaves. This is generally faster than not selling them.
\item After selling them, it means that in Part 2 you get a much faster birthday menu. Without having any Tea Leaves, you can just mash \bbutton\, instead of needing to press \down\abutton.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Every time that the game asks you to either do \textbf{Manual Instruct} or \autoInstruct, always choose \autoInstruct
\item Whenever a Student asks for a Goal Change, mash \bbutton
\item Every event can be skipped by mashing \bbutton, unless otherwise specified by the route.
\item This includes birthdays, which as long as you sell the Tea Leaves, you can always skip by just mashing \bbutton
\end{itemize}
