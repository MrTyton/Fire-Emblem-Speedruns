\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Skipping Dialogue and Cutscenes}

\begin{itemize}
\item Press + to skip most cutscenes.
\item Some cutscenes (usually animated ones) require an extra dialogue to skip it. You can buffer the inputs for these to skip them quickly - hold left while mashing +, then when prompted to pick yes or no, the cursor should buffer into the left option.
\item Unnskippable dialogue cutscenes have a feature to hold B to speed through them, but that's slower - you typically want to mash A and B (preferably alternatively, if you can). Examples of such cutscenes include Rhea's Lance of Ruin cutscene, picking a house, or Seteth's chapter 6 cutscene.
\item Keep mashing at the end of cutscenes. Unskippable cutscenes also have a several second pause with a fadeout unless you press A or B.
