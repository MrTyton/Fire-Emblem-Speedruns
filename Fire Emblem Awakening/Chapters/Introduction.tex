These are the Speedrun Notes for Fire Emblem: Awakening Any\% Normal/Classic.

A few things to keep in mind:

\begin{itemize}
	\item There is a heavy amount of RNG in this run. Don't get discouraged from it.
	\item You need a \textbf{Second Seal} to spawn in an \anna\ shop before Chapter 7.
	\item You can mash \textbf{Start} to skip through cutscenes, dialogue, turn announcements, etc. Basically, keep on mashing \textbf{Start}
	\item Hold down \textbf{Down+A} during \textbf{Level Ups!} in order to clear the boxes faster.
	\item Hold down \textbf{A} while the map is loading, and then either hold down \textbf{A} or \textbf{Y} during movement on the map to go faster.
	\item You are allowed to use a save file to start your run, with a pre-setup Avatar. Timing begins on Save File Selection.
	\item Remeber to have fun!!
\end{itemize}
